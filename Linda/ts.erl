% The Tuplespace.
% CurrentList contains appended data from clients.
% QueueList contains sought data from blocked clients. It also carry the reference number of the call from client
% and the PID from the client.
% tuplespace reacts on message passing from clients.
% Given a client's request to take out a data, it will search through the
% server's list of appended data in CurrentList and pass it to the client is possible,
% otherwise the request will be stored in the QueueList - including the PID of which
% if was requested from and also the corresponding reference number.
% Given a client's request to put in a data, the server will search through the
% QueueList if there is any candidates to pass it to, otherwise it will be
% appended in CurrentList for later usage.
